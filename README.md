Writex

Modern blog/knowledge platform with a React (Vite) frontend and an Express + MongoDB backend.

Live demo: https://writtex.onrender.com/
Tech Stack

Frontend: React 19, Vite, React Router, Tailwind CSS, TipTap, Framer Motion
Backend: Node.js, Express, Mongoose (MongoDB), JWT, bcryptjs, dotenv, cors
Tooling: ESLint, Concurrently, Nodemon
Monorepo Structure

.
├── Backend/            # Express API server
├── writex/             # React (Vite) web app
├── package.json        # Root scripts (concurrently runs both apps)
└── README.md
Prerequisites

Node.js 18+ and npm
MongoDB connection string
Environment Variables

Create a .env file in Backend/ with at least:

PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<user>:<pass>@<cluster>/<db>?retryWrites=true&w=majority
JWT_SECRET=replace-with-strong-secret
Optionally, in writex/ create .env for frontend settings:

VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
# If you use Supabase in the app:
# VITE_SUPABASE_URL=...
# VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=...
Install

From the repository root:

npm install
This installs the root dev tool concurrently. Then install app-level deps (first run will trigger installs when you start, but you can also do it explicitly):

cd Backend && npm install
cd ../writex && npm install
Development

From the repository root you can start both apps together:

npm run dev
This runs (per root package.json):

server: cd writex && npm run dev (starts Vite dev server)
client: cd backend && npm start (starts Express via Nodemon)
Run them separately if you prefer:

# Backend
cd Backend
npm start

# Frontend
cd writex
npm run dev
Build (Frontend)

cd writex
npm run build
Then preview locally:

npm run preview
Scripts Reference

Root: npm run dev – start frontend + backend concurrently
Backend: npm start – run Express with Nodemon
Frontend: npm run dev | npm run build | npm run preview
Folder Highlights

Backend/models/ – Mongoose schemas
Backend/controller/ – Route controllers
writex/src/ – React app code (routes, components, TipTap editor, styles)
Notes

Ensure the backend PORT matches the frontend VITE_API_URL if calling APIs locally.
If CORS is enabled, add your frontend origin in the backend CORS configuration.
